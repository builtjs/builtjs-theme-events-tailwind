        "answer": "<p>The WCS newsletter is available to everyone. You do not need to be a subscriber or donor to receive it, although it would be great if you became one! It is sent out when we are promoting a concert or other event. If other presenters' concerts do not clash with ours, and we think they would appeal to our supporters, we are happy to include information about these too.</p>"

        "question": "What is the difference between a subscription and a donation?",
        "answer": "<p>The annual subscription is only $10 and the donation size is over to you! The WCS presents one concert/event each year just for subscribers and donors to thank them for their support. The subscription year begins following the AGM in January. However, donations and subscriptions are welcomed at any time of year.</p>"

        "question": "How are musicians chosen to perform in Wanaka?",
        "answer": "<p>The WCS receives information annually about groups travelling throughout New Zealand in Chamber Music New Zealand's Regional Tours programme, from which we choose two or three concerts a year. Groups are chosen according to instrumentation, repertoire, and the time of year they wish to perform. We attempt to present as much variety as possible in our year’s programme. Jazz is very popular and when possible we include it in our annual repertoire.</p>"

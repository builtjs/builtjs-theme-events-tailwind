We have hosted violinist Natalia Lomeiko twice and she is always keen to return. Natalia is the inaugural winner of the Sir Michael Hill International Violin Competition and is currently a Professor at the Royal College of Music, London.<br><br>Jazz is very popular in Wanaka and in 2019 top American trumpet player, Allen Vizzutti and his wife, pianist Laura Vizzutti amazed the spell-bound audience with their unique techniques, sense of humour and sheer delight of performance.<br><br>One of the aims of the Wanaka Concert Society is to support young people - admission is free to our concerts for students at school. We also host the current young recipients of the annual Royal Over-Seas League Pettman/ROSL Scholarship for Chamber Ensembles. Master classes are facilitated for music students by some of our visiting performers.<br><br>The Wanaka Concert Society is administered by an annually elected group of music lovers. The inspiration and work carried out by the founding committee over 40 years ago is very much appreciated. One of the wonderful projects undertaken was fundraising for and purchase of our Steinway Grand Piano, of which we are immensely proud. It is praised not only by local pianists but also acclaimed international pianists.<br><br>The Wanaka Concert Society appreciates the support of its donors, subscribers, sponsors and volunteers which enables us to present the very best of music available."
